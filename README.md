## About this Project
This is my Portfolio, which shows a little about myself, lists my projects within GitHub and a way to show some of my knowledge.
## Why?
I wanted to put into practice things I had already thought about and also do new things I had never done before.
I had several cool ideas to put into practice in this Portfolio, like putting a translator for every application, but I had never done that,
researching I discovered the i18n library and with it I was able to translate everything I needed and even learned a new functionality.

I managed to show some of the functionality of my projects on GitHub with the animation of a small Gif that I put on a Card along with the description of each project and its technologies.
## Getting Started

```bash
yarn
then to start
